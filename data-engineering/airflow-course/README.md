# **Airflow Course**

Airflow is a platform created by the community to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows. This section of the repo has a direct reference to my other repo [airflow-master](https://github.com/Elkinmt19/airflow-master), this repo has some examples and documentation about Airflow and how to used it.
