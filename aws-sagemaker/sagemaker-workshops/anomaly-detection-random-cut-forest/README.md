# Anomaly Detection with Random Cut Forest

In this [section](https://sagemaker-workshop.com/builtin/rcf.html), you’ll work your way through a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to use a built-in algorithm in SageMaker. More specifically, you’ll use SageMaker’s Random Cut Forest (RCF) algorithm, an algorithm designed to detect anomalous data points within a dataset. Examples of when anomalies are important to detect include when website activity uncharacteristically spikes, when temperature data diverges from a periodic behaviour, or when changes to public transit ridership reflect the occurrence of a special event.
