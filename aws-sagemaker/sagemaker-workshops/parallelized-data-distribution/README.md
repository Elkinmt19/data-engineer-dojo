# Parallelized Data Distribution

In this [section](https://sagemaker-workshop.com/builtin/parallelized.html), you will learn about how to take full advantage of distributed training clusters when using one of SageMaker’s built-in algorithms. This section also shows how to use SageMaker’s built-in algorithms via hosted Jupyter notebooks, the AWS CLI, and the SageMaker console.
