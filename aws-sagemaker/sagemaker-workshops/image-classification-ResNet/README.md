# Image Classification with ResNet

In this [section](https://sagemaker-workshop.com/builtin/resnet.html), you’ll work your way through a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to use a built-in algorithm in SageMaker. More specifically, you’ll use SageMaker’s image classification algorithm, a supervised learning algorithm that takes an image as input and classifies it into one of multiple output categories. It uses a convolutional neural network (ResNet) that can be trained from scratch, or trained using transfer learning when a large number of training images are not available. In this section you’ll train the image classification algorithm from scratch on the Caltech-256 dataset.
